## Knapsack Problem

## 1. Description

The Knapsack Problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. Given a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, the objective is to select a subset of items to maximize the total value without exceeding the knapsack's capacity.

This project offers efficient solutions for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming. It is designed to be flexible, enabling users to experiment with various item lists and knapsack sizes via a command-line interface.

## 2. Features

- Dynamic programming implementation for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem
- Support for different knapsack capacities and item lists
- Command-line interface for testing custom instances

## 3. Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ranto-dev/Knapsack_Problem.git
cd Knapsack_Problem
```

### Usage

Run `index.html` file in your browser to launch the interactive demo.
